This utility allows for quick sandbox testing of the [@yext/phonenumber-util](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yext/phonenumber-util) JS utility.

#### Install and Use

```bash
git clone [repo]
cd [repo]
npm i
npm start 
```

While running, the server will run on port `8080`.  Visit your instance at http://localhost:8080.

#### Why?

I wanted a quick means of demonstrating the use of phonenumber-util, better understand websockets and also enjoy building things without dependencies.
